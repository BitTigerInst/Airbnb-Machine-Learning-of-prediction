# Airbnb-Machine-Learning-of-prediction

## Description

This project was inpired by the Airbnb New User Bookings competition on Kaggle. Our primary goal is to predict whether a new user is going to book on Airbnb based on the data sets provided by Airnbnb. An example output data will be a list of users' booking probability. 

Our ultimate goal is to accurately predicting which country a new user will book their first travel experience.

## Plan

Based on our experiences on data mining and descriptions mentioned above, we plan to take *4 weeks* time as the **1st stage** with the **primary** goal. Here're some tentative schedules.
